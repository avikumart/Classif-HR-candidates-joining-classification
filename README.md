This dataset was part of recruitment process of a perticular client of ScaleneWorks. ScaleneWorks supports several information technology (IT) companies in india with talent acquisition. One of the challange they face is about 30% of the candidate who accept the jobs offer, do not join th compnay, this leads to huge loss of revenue and time as the companies initiate the recrutiment process again to fill thw workforce demand.  SceleneWorks wants to find out if a model can be built to predict the likelihood of a candidates along with a column that indicates if the candidate finally joined the company or not.
